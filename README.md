## About Me ðŸŒ´
Nice to meet you! My name is Adriana Arroyo, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I'm also in the process of obtaining a Programming and Systems Specialist (EPS) credential sponsored by the 21st Century Techforce program from the Department of Economic Development and Commerce of Puerto Rico. I've previously worked with Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, and have around 1.5 years of experience programming.

### âš¡ Fun fact
My first bachelor's in Industrial Microbiology, and I have worked around three years in the medical device and pharmaceutical industry. My very first "programming" experience was helping prepare a website to showcase a research project I'd been contributing to as a Junior. I enjoyed myself a lot, and never imagined that years later after graduating I'd decide to pursue a career in the Tech Industry.
